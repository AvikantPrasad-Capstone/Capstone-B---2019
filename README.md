# Cyber Attack Detection in Computer Systems: A Deep Learning Approach 

Within this repository, will show the practical side of my capstone project that will involve trying to create a framework that will determine cyberattacks with high accuracy, by incoperating Machine and Deep Learning.  This will be done by using two individual datasets one being the KDD Cup 99 dataset and other being the CICIDS2017 dataset, more of which will be outlined below.

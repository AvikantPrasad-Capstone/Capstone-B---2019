# Cyber Attack Detection in Computer Systems: A Deep Learning Approach 

Within this repository, will show the practical side of my capstone project that will involve trying to create a framework that will determine cyberattacks with high accuracy, by incoperating Machine and Deep Learning.  This will be done by using two individual datasets one being the KDD Cup 99 dataset and other being the CICIDS2017 dataset, more of which will be outlined below. 

# CICIDS2017 Dataset 

CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attacks. This dataset has been split up into verious days of the week whereby different attacks and number of attacks defer from one another. The specific dataset that has been used for this project is the Wednesday, July 5, 2017 CICIDS2017 dataset which has 6 different attack types with 79 feature values. Code for this is allocated in CICIDS2017 file.

# Cyber Attack Detection in Computer Systems: A Deep Learning Approach 

Within this repository, will show the practical side of my capstone project that will involve trying to create a framework that will determine cyberattacks with high accuracy, by incoperating Machine and Deep Learning.  This will be done by using two individual datasets one being the KDD Cup 99 dataset and other being the CICIDS2017 dataset, more of which will be outlined below. 

# KDD CUP99 Dataset

The KDD Cup99 Dataset is a widely known Intrusion Detection Dataset that compromises of 42 features and 24 attack types. The below code shows a representaion of the KDD 10% Corrected dataset being trained on a neural network.
